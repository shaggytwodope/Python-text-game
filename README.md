# Python-text-game

Run game.py to start the game.

The other files except game.py is obsolete. Not sure if I wish to remove them just yet.

I just started this project to learn how to program. I chosed python for no apparent reason.



###currently how you equip
playerDamage = equip("sword"). This is not yet implemented.


###Main.py

I'm making a main.py script to look for inputs. It's mostly for experimenting atm. It is not in use atm, I need to make so more functions and such before it can be used.

####change log
<b>7/10-15:</b>  
Renamed game.py to oldgame.py and test to game.py

Made a inventory prototype. seems to work. Now I need to fix playerDamage. I've set the variable todo to done, since after putting everything into one file, it works.

I made askEquip, and edited equip to handle equiping of the weapon. It currently won't update playerWeapon, and I haven't implemeted the damage buff thing. 

I made test.py, which is a combination of every file. Now the game works flawlessly.

I've started to create the pickup function. I now need to figure out how to move the variables outside of the function and function.py and into the game.py and variable.py.
